## jpvc-convert

A Linux tool to convert any GTA: Vice City version to the Japanese version of the game - based on zoton2's script but for Linux.

## Dependencies
- GTA Vice City 
- xdelta3

## How to use
- Launch the game once to generate your Wine prefix;
- Export your WINE_PREFIX environment variable, making it point to your prefix;
- Copy the files to your GTA VICE CITY installation file and run convert.sh.

## Disclaimer 
While this tool works exactly like the approved one, it has yet not been reviewed and/or approved by a VC leaderboard moderator, so until I'm able to verify with them, using this may get your run refused on the srcom leaderboards.
